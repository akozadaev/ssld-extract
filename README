ssld-extract v1.04, Alex Kozadaev(c)

SSLDump filtering tool

  ssld-extact [-n x,y | -p n,m] [ssldump filename | - to read from pipe]

  Extract one or more connections from a SSL dump file.
  
  Usage:
    -n    comma separated list of connection numbers (no spaces allowed)
    -p    comma separated list of client port numbers (no spaces allowed)
    -h    this text

  PLEASE NOTE: -n overrides -p, so when used together -p will not have any effect.

fixed in v1.04:
1. added boundry checking when reading the connection line. This would prevent SIGSEGV crushes on malformed ssldump captures
